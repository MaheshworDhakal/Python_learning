//Pointers in C
A pointer in C is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
 
Rather than holding the actual data value, it holds the location of the data in memory.

 Pointers are crucial in C because they allow direct memory access and manipulation, 
 making them useful for dynamic memory allocation, arrays,
 
  function arguments, and handling complex data structures.

//Key Concepts of Pointers

//Pointer Declaration:
 A pointer is declared using the * operator. 
 The type of the pointer must match the type of the data it will point to.


type *pointer_name;
Example:


int *ptr; // Pointer to an integer
float *fptr; // Pointer to a float

//Pointer Initialization: 
To initialize a pointer,
 you assign it the address of a variable using the & (address-of) operator.


int var = 5;
int *ptr = &var; // ptr holds the address of var
//Dereferencing a Pointer:
 Dereferencing a pointer means accessing the value stored at the address the pointer is pointing to.
  This is done using the * operator.


int var = 5;
int *ptr = &var;
printf("%d", *ptr); // Output: 5 (value stored at ptr's address)
Address-of Operator (&): The & operator is used to get the memory address of a variable.

Example:


int var = 10;
int *ptr = &var;  // ptr holds the address of var
//Pointer Arithmetic: 
Pointers can be incremented or decremented using arithmetic operations. 
When you increment or decrement a pointer, it doesn't just move by 1 byte; 
it moves by the size of the data type it points to.

Example:


int arr[] = {1, 2, 3};
int *ptr = arr; // Points to the first element in the array
printf("%d\n", *ptr);     // Output: 1 (first element)
ptr++;
printf("%d\n", *ptr);     // Output: 2 (second element)

//Null Pointer: 
A null pointer is a pointer that does not point to any valid memory location. 
It is often used to indicate that a pointer is not initialized or has no valid memory to point to.


int *ptr = NULL;
//Pointer to Pointer:
 A pointer to a pointer is a variable that stores the address of another pointer.
  This allows multi-level indirection, which is useful in complex data structures like arrays of arrays, dynamic arrays, etc.


int var = 10;
int *ptr = &var; // Pointer to var
int **pptr = &ptr; // Pointer to ptr
//Pointer to Function: 
Pointers can also point to functions. 
This allows for dynamic function calls (such as callback functions).

void hello() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
}

int main() {
    void (*func_ptr)() = hello; // Pointer to function hello
    func_ptr();  // Calls hello() function
}
//Example Program Using Pointers
Here's an example demonstrating the use of pointers in C:


#include <stdio.h>

void updateValue(int *ptr) {
    *ptr = 20;  // Dereferencing ptr to change the value of the original variable
}

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    int *ptr = &num; // Pointer to num

    printf("Before update: %d\n", *ptr); // Output: 10
    
    // Passing the pointer to a function to update the value
    updateValue(ptr);
    
    printf("After update: %d\n", *ptr); // Output: 20

    return 0;
}
Explanation:
The ptr pointer is initialized to the address of num.
The updateValue() function takes a pointer as an argument and modifies the value at the address the pointer points to.
The *ptr syntax dereferences the pointer to access the value stored at the memory location it points to.
